# Pantry Tracker

This project is a pantry inventory management application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Firebase. It allows users to add, remove, search, and manage items in their pantry. The app is built using Material-UI components for the UI and Firebase Firestore for data storage.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Add new items to your pantry inventory.
- **Remove Items:** Remove or decrease the quantity of items in your inventory.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for items by name.
- **Real-time Updates:** Automatically updates the inventory list as changes are made.
- **Modal for Adding Items:** A modal dialog to facilitate adding new items.
- **Edit Option (Placeholder):** A placeholder for editing items (feature not yet implemented).

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/pantry-tracker.git](https://github.com/ba-00001/REACT_APP_pantry_tracker)
cd pantry-tracker
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
